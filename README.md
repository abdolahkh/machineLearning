In this repository I shared my project with ML diffrent algurithms. for example Linear regression, Classification, Logistic Regression an another algurithm and another algurithm.

## What I'm doing here?
I'm here shared my code projects of machine learning models. Linear regression models, classification models and another project about ML, Data Ccience and Artifical Intelligence.
